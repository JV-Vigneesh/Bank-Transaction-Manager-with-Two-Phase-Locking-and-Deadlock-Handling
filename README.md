# Bank-Transaction-Manager-with-Two-Phase-Locking-and-Deadlock-Handling


**Description:** Build a mini banking system where multiple concurrent transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers) are processed safely.

1. Implement Two-Phase Locking (2PL) to maintain serializability.
2. Simulate shared and exclusive locks.
3. Include deadlock detection and resolution using wait-for graph.

**Key Concepts:** 2PL, lock escalation, deadlock handling, transaction isolation.
